# HTML Notes

Hypertext markup language. HTML. This is a coding language (text) using various symbols (markup) designed out of a desire to quickly (hyper) jump from one website to another. The histroy of html is fascinating, but there are some key points to keep in mind.

## Tags, Elements, Attributes

1. Tags

A tag is how a browser knows how and where to identify an element. Typically there is a start and end tag. These delineate the beginning and end of a particular element.

> ex: <tagstart> element </tagend>

2. Elements

An element tells a browser what it is dealing with. A browser may display parts of a site in a specific way depending on the element used. Elements tell the browser "do this or that depending on what I am."

3. Attributes

Attributes are a way to define an element; they provide additional information about the contensts of an element. 

### Making invisible notes

Use the <!-- --> tags to make notes on your site that will not render on the page. This is a good way to leave hidden messages for other programmers if they are also working on the website. 

## ID vs. Class Attribute
