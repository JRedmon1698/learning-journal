# Text Editors: This or That?

## Basic Editors
By "basic" I mean included with your computer. While it is possible to write code and design web pages on these types of editors, you may find yourself at a disadvantage due to the lack of features. 

Examples of features you may want but would not find with a basic text editor include:
+ auto-filling
+ cool themes
+ color-specific demarcation of elements, variables, functions, etc. 

## Third Party Options
There are a number of "aftermarket" text editors to choose from. Many of these offer all the bells and whistles you want and need for your text editing. Although it's hard to say which option is best, a few standards include:
1. Atom
2. Brackets
3. VS Code
4. NotePad++

As for me, I will probably play around with a few of these until I find one that feels right. 


## IDE's
> Integrated Development Environment

IDE's represent more than just another form of thirrd party text editor. While these include the options of a normal third party text editor, they also include many other features including compiling, file management, and debugging. 

*IDE's are to text editors as Swiss Army Knives are to butter knives.*
