# Growth Mindset

Growth mindset: it's what separates the doers from the dreamers. It can be the difference between getting stuck in soul-draining monotony and landing your **dream** job.

## How I Get There

Maintaining a *growth mindset* means I will strive to:
* always move forward
* stay adaptable
* learn to be comfortable with discomfort
* learn to welcome failure
* keep my eye on the big picture (why I am doing what I'm doing)

A growth mindset means focusing on what I can ~~not~~ do. ***This is the only thing that matters: what's possible; not what's impossible.***
