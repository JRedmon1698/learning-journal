# Git vs. GitHub: What's the Difference? 

To understand the differnec ebetween Git ( a technology) and GitHub (an online platform), we must first understand something called Version Control.

## Version Control

Version Control (VS) refers to a system that allows you to revisit different versions of a file or project by taking snapshots of your progress. Made a huge mistake? Use VS to go back a step to a time before your mistake. Unhappy with your final product? Use VS to go back to the foundation of your project and avoid starting from scratch. 

There are three main types of VS:

1. Local Version Control
2. Centralized Version Control
3. Distributed Version Control

### Local Version Control System (LVCS)

A local version control system is one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files and projects.

### Centralized Verison Control System (CVCS)

A centralized version control system is similar to a LVCS, with the big difference being that multiple clients may access all versions of a file or project. Historically this was a big step toward a more collaborative environment for teams working together on projects.

### Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

A distributed version control system eliminates the local server entirely as a single point of failure. To prevent catastrophic losses in the event of a local server being damaged, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. This allows all the teamwork and collaboration of a CVCS, but without the risk of catastrophic losses of versions in the case of local server damage.

## So, What *is* Git?

Git is a DVCS that stores projects in a system of snapshots. Each time you commit changes to a project or file, Git creates a snapshot of your progress and stores a reference to it.
