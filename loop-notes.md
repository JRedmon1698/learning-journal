# Operators

Operators evaluate data. Here we will look at two major types of operators: **comparison operators* and *logical operators*.

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators evaluate data and result in a single true or false output. Some examples of comparison operators:

- `==` 
- (is equal to)

- `!=` 
- (is not equal to)

- `===`
- (is strictly equal to)

- `!==`
- (is not strictly equal to)

*Note: these operators will either evaluate to true or false.*

Other operators you are probably familar with (<, >, <=, etc.).


### Logical Operators

Logical operators compare results of more than one comparison operator. Below are examples of logical operators with some explanation:

- `&&`
- (logical and)
>  For `((2 < 5) && (3>=))` If both expressions evaluate to true, then the expression returns true. If just one expression is false, it will return false. 

- `||`
- (logical or)
> For `(( 2 < 5) || (2 < 1))` If either expresion or both are true, then the expression returns true. Only if both expressions are false will the expression return false.
