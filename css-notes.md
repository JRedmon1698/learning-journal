> Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is the styling side of a website. It uses rules that act on html elements to make the site look pretty (or not pretty).

## Important Components to Know

1. Selector
    * selectors indicate which htm element a CSS rule applies to
    * it essentially "links up" with a corresponding html tag
2. Declaration 
    - declarations indicate how the html element referred to in selector should be styled
    - consists of 'property: value'
3. Property
    - indicates the aspect of the element you want to change
4. Value
    - specifies the settings you want to use for the chosen properties

## Color!

Styling includes color. Period. But it's not that simple...

There are 147 predefined color names to be used in CSS. But there are wya more colors than just that. We use hex decimal codes that contain an RGB value to get really gritty with coloring. These allow us to choose from a much braoder spectrum of color. 

- Hex Decimal Code
    > Ex. #XXYYZZ, where XX indicates an R value, YY indicates a G value, and ZZ indicates a B value

RGB (RedGreenBlue) values range between 0-255. These numbers specifiy where on a color spectrum a color lies.
