## Computers: What's in a Name? 

What does it mean to "compute" something? Basically to compute something means to calculate or figure (in a mathemetical sense). Not new, right? But computers do so much more than arithmatic, so whay are they called "computers?" 

To understand that we need to take a look at some founding pronciples of computation. 

## Computers: The Basics

Modern computers all work the same way. There are four basic functions they perform that collectively earn them the right to be called "computer." THese basic functions are **input**, **storage**, **processing**, and **output**. 

### Input

Input is any information from the outside world *going into* a computer. Using a mouse or a keyboard, touch screens, voice commands, game controllers, and even your heart rate being read by a sensor are all forms of input. THis is information that a computer can use and/or manipulate to eventually generate output.

### Storage

Computers need a place to store the information coming in from the outside world (input) as well as any needed instructions to perform actions on input. It also needs to store output as well. This is where storage comes in handy; it is simply a digital storage shed for all this information. 

### Processing

Processing is the process by which a computer analyzes and manipulates information in a specific way according to instructions to generate output. Processing functions vary widely. It could be basic math or very highly-advanced algorithms. 
> What's key to understand here is the processing is a combination of millions or billions of basic calculations (more to come). 

### Output

Once a computer has recieved input, stored it, and processed it, it produces an output based on instructions it has. Output could be typed words, pictures and videos, music and sounds, numbers and data, advanced games and graphics, websites, etc. Anything that you consume from a computer. Output can be relayed through computer monitors, speaks, headphones, vibrations and haptics, printed sheets and pictures, and much more.
