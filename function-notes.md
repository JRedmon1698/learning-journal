# Functions in JS
    Functions are what make JavaScript to fun! The'yre the basic "moving parts." JS uses functions to manipulate **objects** using **expressions** and **operators** to get **values.**

## Expressions

An expression results in (evaluates into) a single value. There are two main types of expressions:
        
        1. assigns a value to a variable
        2. uses two or more values to return a single value

## Operators

An operator allows programming to crete a single value from one or more values (think second type of expression). 

> Some common operators:
    `++` adds 1 to current number
    `--` subtracts 1 from current number

## Calling vs. Declaring Functions

*Calling* a function involves asking a function to perform its defined task. *Decalring* a function involves creating a function that can be called later in code. 

### Other important things to know

* Paramater: a piece of information needed for a function to complete its defined task
* Return Value: the response of a run function
